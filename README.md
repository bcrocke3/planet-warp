# planet-warp
Semester project for CSCI 4616/5616: Intro to Virtual Reality

Using Unity version 2021.3.9f1

Our goal is to simulate being on the planets (except Earth) with VR scenes. We have one scene for every planet. In the future, we would like the experience to be such that the player can move around the scenes as they please. For now, we have videos of camera animations through the scene and standstill videos of the scene. We added features such as wind, sound, partile systems, and fog to help simulate what the surfaces of planets (and atmospheres for planets with no surface) would be like.

For the milestone 1 requirements, the Spaceship scene contains a binocular stereoscopic camera, while the rest of the scenes include a monocular camera. (The video walkthrough was taken with just one of the stereoscopic cameras so that is easier to watch.)
